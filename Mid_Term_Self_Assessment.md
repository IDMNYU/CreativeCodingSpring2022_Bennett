# DM-UY 1133-A Creative Coding
##### Fall 2022 • Katherine Bennett • Monday & Wednesdays • 12:00-13:50


#### MidTerm Self-Assessment

##### Due: Week 8 18:00 EST

It's important that you personally evaluate your progress in this class. It's an opportunity to look at what you are struggling with, what you are succeeding at, where you need to push yourself and to develop a plan for further development. It's a time to reflect on the larger picture.

Write a page which discusses the aspects below. Make sure to address *EACH* point _thoroughly_. It must be thoughtful and considered. The time and the degree of depth and thoughtfulness is what advances you to a higher grade.  Spell check your paper before you submit the document to me! Attach the PDF document to a Slack direct message with me.


• Critically analyze/evaluate how much time was spent learning syntax & structure, programming concepts vs. actually programming. How does this reflect on the final quality of your end result?

• Comment on your successes and frustrations with Processing and P5.js.

• What are you struggling with conceptually? What are you struggling with coding-wise? Lastly, what are you struggling with creatively/ideation?

• What measures are you going to take to improve your work in _and_ for class? Are these weekly actionable tasks? Tell me a about it. (some examples might include asking questions in class, doing the readings, reviewing the readings, getting a tutor, starting a study group, doing the assigned readings, working your study schedule to allow for both reading and programming, particular time management techniques, etc, etc).

• What could happen during class to help your understanding of the course material? What concepts are you interested in learning more about? What concepts would you like to have reviewed?
