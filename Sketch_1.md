# DM-UY 1133-A Creative Coding
##### Fall 2022 • Katherine Bennett • Monday & Wednesdays • 12:00-13:50

## Sketch 1 Composition

#### Due Feb 7th 18:00 EST 
#### Submit on openProcessing (check Slack announcement channel for invitation and syllabus for URL)
			
_Come to class on Feb 7th with the sketch started and we will demo how to submit it together in class_

Create a sketch that uses a multitude of shapes, and shapes that are different. Use a variety of colors, both for the shapes and the background. Create a composition or collage with these shapes. I encourage you to be abstract, rather than literal. Yet, in the abstract, there can be some likeness to reality.

Check out the Slides on Slack (resources channel) for inspiration tips and possibilities

Recommendations: Do not do this in one sitting. Take breaks. Work on this in several sessions (and not the night before it's due).


#### Key aspects:

* Think: density and diversity of shapes. Take up the entire sketch window
* On the https://processing.org/reference/, utilize the listings under: 2D Primitives, Curves, Attributes, Vertex, and Color
* Use a variety of different shapes, and different sizes
* Create your own shapes using beginShape(), vertex(), endShape()
* Use a variety of colors, different colors, different ranges of the same color
* Play with opacity
* When you are playing with opacity, also play with layering shapes on top of one another
* Understanding screen coordinates (where to place the shapes), creating shapes, using color, opacity are key here in building your compositions
* Your sketch size must be 800 x 800 pixels
* You may take a “meaty” crop of one of these images and re-create it
* Your code must yield the final result. It is not user generated (ie, mouse values, key values) and it is not randomly generated. 
* Don’t wait for inspiration to start the homework. Just start. 
* Don’t wait until you like something or have an idea. Just start.

#### Tips:

* [Useful resources for curves (switch tab to playground)](http://yining1023.github.io/p5PlayGround/) 
* [Tutorial on Curves](https://processing.org/tutorials/curves/)
* Drawing out your composition on graph paper first, will help you understand coordinates. Make the top left corner (0, 0)
* Creating an interactive cross-hairs (see example sketches given in class)
