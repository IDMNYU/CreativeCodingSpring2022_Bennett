## MidTerm Project  - The Unexpected Machine: Performance Adjective

**Due  March 21st & March 23 In class critiques** <br>
**Final Submissions Due April 4th midnight to openProcessing **

**20% of your final grade**

### Must be completed in p5.js

Weekly pushes and development are expected

Pick an adjective and make a program that graphically illustrates that adjective interactively/responsively or by animation. Time is an element here. What we are seeing, must change over time. It is not a flat image. You may not use images nor pixels. You may not use an external library. You may not use sound. You may not use text. Use only drawing functions, and things that create graphics. You are to illustrate this adjective over time. Think of it as a performance that unfolds and builds to reveal your adjective.

You are challenged to not be literal. For example, do not draw a smiley face that then frowns to show sadness. You are encouraged to be abstract.

You are to use expressive mark making as your tool.

Start with a small, very simple shape. Just start.

The goal of this assignment is to explore, experiment and to ideate. As a result, you don't have to know the outcome from when you start. But you must demonstrate a rigerous investigation, with exploration, experimentation and ideation.

You are to explore this adjective, and to transcribe it's meaning, through mark making via procedural graphics. Think about the energy your adjective describes. How can you translate that to movement with this small shape? How does that movement change over time? In addition to movement, explore color, size, opacity, etc. What happens after a collection of them are drawn? Can you create patterns and textures that describe this adjective?

After experiencing the duration of your piece, we will guess your adjective. As such, think of this as a performance: You have the entire performance to use to help transcribe your adjective. Think about building, things that change over time, procedures, drama, and events.

Use only the drawing functions - stuff found in the Shape, Color, Events and Math sections. Make sure to read Learning Processing Chapters 13 + 14, as well as the Generative Design Text.

Create custom functions that are triggered on some event, and make those functions vary. The focus of this project is procedural intensity. How expressive can you be with only line, shapes, color and movement?

Do not be literal. Do not create a smiley face to convey happiness. Nor a snowperson to illustrate coldness. You are challenged to move beyond the crutches of tradition to create your own language of expression. Think instead of shape, color, size, duration, change, movement, transformation, intensity, etc.

### Ingredients: <br>

• Graphics (shape, color, line, placement, custom shapes) <br>
• Control Structures (if, for, while) <br>
• Movement <br>
• Interaction (mouse, keyboard)<br>
• Custom functions with passing parameters<br>
• Arrays<br>
• Math <br>
• Random <br>
• Functions

### Must haves: 
<br>
	• heavy use of variables<br>
	• custom functions passing variables as parameter <br>
	• loops <br>
	• control structures <br>
	• math or random <br>
	• some use of interaction or change over time <br>
	• movement, change, variety <br>
	• arrays <br>
	• conditionals <br>
	• OOP - with methods + passing parameters <br>

	
To give you an idea of how much development I'm looking for, your code should be well beyond 100 lines of code, which incorporates the concepts we've learned thus far. Spacing, comments or commented out code are not counted as lines.

Weekly pushes to your **GitHub Repo are required** I will be reviewing these to note the strides and steady development. This is not a project that can be done in one sitting. If you do so, you are missing the value of this assignment.
