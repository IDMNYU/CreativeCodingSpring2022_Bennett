### Sketch 2

### Interactive Repetition & Drawing: Modularity, Pattern


#### TENATIVELY Due Feb 15th 21:00 EST. Due at this time unless specified otherwise

        

 Using 1 small line or small simple shape (ellipse), twist or turn it and position it within space. Repeat this process, changing the orientation and position, yet keeping it close to the previous shape. Repeat this process at least 3-5 more times. By the end, you should a clustered arrangement of similar shapes. Wrap this into a code block: either a for-loop or a simple function for-loop combo. Use variables to manipulate the location coordinates. For example, 35 + x.

 Now, thing of this cluster of shapes, as one stamp.

 Use the previously created arrangement of shapes, as the stamp that you will use to create different patterns across the sketch window. You will call this stamp multiple times. From this multitude of calls, a pattern will emerge.

 How you structure your for-loops (calling this stamp), will control how that pattern is made.

 You are to create 5 DRASTICALLY different patterns, using the same cluster of shapes. Focus on trying to control the location of each stamp, by manipulating those location coordinates. <strong>Start with creating one grid. Then in subsequent (and different patterns), manipulate that grid so that it is less grid-like.</strong> _How can you start to deviate from a grid? How can that grid be transformed into a cone? Or strips? Can you skip every other one?_

 Variables, loops, and exit conditions are your key. Play and experiment here. Try different things out. Play with your operators in your for-loop (+, -, *, /), as well as how much you are operating by (ie, +1, -2, /.5, *5.5). 

 What happens when you throw an if-statement within the for-loop? <---- Try it out!

 EXPERIMENT WITH YOUR OPERATORS, LOOP CONDITIONS, & IF-STATEMENTS

 Consider different rhythms that you can make with spacing, direction/orientation and repetition. Use a keyPress to switch between different patterns. As a result, all of your patterns should appear in ONE sketch

 - use active mode
 - use variables, manipulate variables
 - passing parameters
 - use loops (for, while). Make sure there is an exit condition
 - use a conditional(s) to make your pattern interesting, unique, and to have variety
