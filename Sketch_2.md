### Sketch 2

### Interactive Repetition & Drawing: Modularity, Pattern


#### Step 1 is due before class on Feb 16th
##### Step 2: Due Feb 23rd due by 17:00

        
##### Step 1:
 
 - Using 1 small line or small simple shape (ellipse), twist or turn it and position it within space. Repeat this process, changing the orientation and position, yet keeping it close to the previous shape. Repeat this process at least 3-5 more times. By the end, you should a clustered arrangement of similar shapes. Now, thing of this cluster of shapes, as one stamp.

 - Apply a variable to these shapes location coordinates, such as "50 + x" "100 + y"

 - Wrap these lines of code into a function. Check that function by calling that function.

 - Then pass parameters for that function, that are then used within that function, such as myCluster(int x, int y)

 - Then call that function multiple times passing different values to it each time. (You can create parameters for color, width, height, etc)

 - Now, call that function inside a simple for-loop. Use the for-loop to create multiple instances of the shape cluster. But, they cannot appear on top of one another and they must appear on the sketch (ie, no background update)



##### Step 2: Due Feb 23rd due by 17:00


 Use the previously created arrangement of shapes, as the stamp that you will use to create different patterns across the sketch window. You will call this stamp multiple times. From this multitude of calls, a pattern will emerge.

 How you structure your for-loops (calling this stamp), will control how that pattern is made.

 You are to create 5 DRASTICALLY different patterns, using the same cluster of shapes. Focus on trying to control the location of each stamp, by manipulating those location coordinates. <strong>Start with creating one grid. Then in subsequent (and different patterns), manipulate that grid so that it is less grid-like.</strong> _How can you start to deviate from a grid? How can that grid be transformed into a cone? Or strips? Can you skip every other one?_

 Variables, loops, and exit conditions are your key. Play and experiment here. Try different things out. Play with your operators in your for-loop (+, -, *, /), as well as how much you are operating by (ie, +1, -2, /.5, *5.5). 

 What happens when you throw an if-statement within the for-loop? <---- Try it out!

 EXPERIMENT WITH YOUR OPERATORS, LOOP CONDITIONS, & IF-STATEMENTS

 Consider different rhythms that you can make with spacing, direction/orientation and repetition. Use a keyPress to switch between different patterns. As a result, all of your patterns should appear in ONE sketch

 - use active mode
 - use variables, manipulate variables
 - passing parameters
 - use loops (for, while). Make sure there is an exit condition
 - use a conditional(s) to make your pattern interesting, unique, and to have variety
