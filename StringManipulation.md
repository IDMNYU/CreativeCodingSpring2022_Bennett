Sketch 4 Choice: String Manipulations - Data Visualizations or Algorithmic Poems

This should be heavily procedural, dynamic, or crunching data. This builds off of what you have learned thus far and takes it further. This is not to simply just have text appear. I am looking for you to take this further and to strengthen your coding chops.

###### Route 1:

1. take a story from [GutenBerg](https://www.gutenberg.org/browse/languages/en)

2. Look over the data.... What would you like to pull out of it? Do you want to look for the number of times a particular word appears? Pull out every 3 word of a sentence? Do you want to combine words? Create new arrangements of words? Subtract or replace particular words?

This will be the data you use to generate a new piece, poem, data visualization, etc.

3. Create the code to find those data points and to "do it's thing."

Use at least 2 expressions to parse the string of text for the precise data you need. Use [the RegExr site](http://regexr.com/) as guide to formulate your expressions

4. Visualize your data in some interesting way. Have the output appear algorithmically. Be thoughtful in this endeavour. Play with timing, location, appearance, font, size, color, existence, animation,  procedural aspects or interactivity 

###### Route 2:

1. Using the <a href = "https://rednoise.org/rita/tutorial/index.php">Rita library</a> (available for both Processing and P5.js)

2. Create a data visualization based on a text, a MadLibs, or a bot

3. That "does something". I.e., There is an interactive experienced, something happens that is dynamic, or a time based animation of some sort.


###### Route 3:

1. Something heavily procedural, time based, having to do with text. 

2. See the Generative Design references for the direction that I am seeking.
