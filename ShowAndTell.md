# DM-UY 1133-A Creative Coding
##### Spring 2020 • Katherine Bennett • Monday & Wednesdays • 2:30-4:20pm 

## Show & Tell

You will be assigned a [Show and Tell presentation date here](ShowAndTell.md). Please research the assigned artist/designers/firms/pieces/collectives in advance. Each presentation will be about 5-7 minutes long. Be able to address the following, along with *3-4 visual examples of each individual or team's work*: 

• What is original/unique about how this artist uses technology? 

• What kind of code did the artist use?  (JavaScript? Flash? Procesing? openFrameworks? VVVV?) How are they using the code? What is the code achieving?

• Why is it necessary that the artist use code?  (ie: particularly if it’s non-interactive, could it have been achieved with traditional or linear media?)

• Your presentation must be prepared and professional. DO NOT USE TEXT ON YOUR SLIDES, other than the artist's/designer's/firm's names. Show. the. work. Discuss. the. work.


### Tips for your presentation (seriously....read and review these. It makes ALL the difference....)

• Do not present to me. Look at your audience, your classmates. You are presenting to them.

• [THOUGHTS ON PUBLIC SPEAKING BY ZACH HOLMAN](http://speaking.io/) Click the links!!!

• Create a 5-7 minutes presentation (pdf, powerpoint, keynote, quicktime, etc.)

• Decide whether or not you want to mirror your presentation or not (if you're using presentation tools - ie, notes)
Get familiar with your display preferences IN. ADVANCE. I'm. Not. Joking.!! I'm not kidding either. Borrow a cable from the student aids, and try it out on your own BEFORE class. Seriously. It makes all the difference in the quality of your presentation and your presentation nerves.

• If you have sound during your presentation, set your external sound preferences in system preferences to Crestron. Test this out on the projector before your present. See above.
